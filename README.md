An Intro to Data Science with Python
====================================

This is the material used for the introduction Data Science with 
Python workshop. It uses Jupyter notebook, pandas, matplotlib,
seaborn, and scikit-learn.

Getting started
===============

Easy route
----------
Install Anaconda from Continuum IO. Supports Windows, Mac, and Linux

Almost as easy route
--------------------
Assuming you are in a \*nix environment and set up to use virtual
environments, you can get set up with the following:

```
mkvirtualenv odsc
git clone https://github.com/dsakagi/odsc-pisa.git
cd odsc-pisa
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It will take a while, especially if you have to compile scikit-learn
